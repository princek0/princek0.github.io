        <h2>About</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Volution was a student led project by myself and 8 others which was entered into the Young Enterprise Company programme. 
                We made an air monitoring system using the RP2040 microcontroller IC and the high-grade GP2Y1014AU optical dust sensor to detect PM2.5 particulate matter including common allergens such as dust, mould, and pollen. The case of our product was 3D printed and an LED was programmed to light up red when a specific threshold of particulate matter concentration was met.
